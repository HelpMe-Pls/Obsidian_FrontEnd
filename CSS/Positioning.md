- The `display` and `position` properties can be used to alter how an element's layout behavior works: `display: block;` for vertical layout and `display: inline` for horizontal. Elements can be removed from the page completely using `display: none;`.

- The `position` property takes several values, most of which (except for `static`) work in combination with directional properties (`top`/ `bottom`/`left`/`right`):
1. `position: static`: follows the default layout flow (i.e. the element is laid out according to its order in HTML and specifying directions won't work)
2. `position: relative`: offset the location by some specified amount (e.g. an element with this rule and `top: 10px` will be rendered `10px` below from where it was if it had `position: static`)
3. `position: absolute`: stays on a *specified* location within the document (***relative*** to its direct containing/parent block), separated from the normal layout flow (i.e. every other elements that are ***not*** *relative* to the *absolutely positioned element* will render as if *it* didn't even exist). For example: an element with this rule and `left: 69px` will be rendered `69px` to the left from its containing block that has `position: relative`. If there's no specified `position: relative` of a containing block, it'll be positioned `69px` to the outermost left of the whole document.
   Particularly useful if we want to create isolated UI features that ***don't*** interfere with the layout of other elements on the page (e.g. popups, control menus, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page,...)
4. `position: fixed`: stays on a specified location in the viewport (ignores ***every*** other elements and their layout flow), even if the document moves around (e.g. an element with this rule and `top: 0px; right: 0px` will a***lways*** stay at the outermost top-right of the document no matter how far you scroll down.
5. `position: sticky`: a mixed option of `relative` and `fixed` that keeps the element in place relative to its parent (e.g. an element with this rule and `top: 0px;` will ***always*** stay on top of its *scrollable* parent that has a `position: relative`)

- `z-index` is a reference to the *z-axis* (imagine the screen is a flat surface, the z-axis is like an arrow shooting straight through it). Its values affect where positioned elements sit on that axis; positive values move them higher up the stack, negative values move them lower down the stack. By default, positioned elements all have a `z-index` of `auto`, which is effectively `0`.
  `z-index` only accepts ***unitless*** index values (i.e. you can't specify that you want one element to be `23px` up the z-axis). Higher values will go above lower values
